# auto_convert_asciio_to_text

## What is this tool used for?

It is mainly used to automatically export binary files we write in 
[asciio](https://github.com/nkh/P5-App-Asciio) to text and insert them into our 
notes. Ensure the accuracy of insertion by setting the start tag and end tag. 
Automatic updating saves users the trouble of manually exporting to notes.

## next plan

- [ ] The list of ascii files and the list of target txt files that need to be 
synchronized should be placed in a configuration file, thereby saving the user 
the trouble of manually entering each time, and the configuration can be easily 
modified.
